# Personal Knowledge System

A reusable structure for building a private, LLM-maintained knowledge system. Works with any markdown-compatible frontend platform.

The core idea is that an LLM should not repeatedly rediscover your knowledge from raw files. Instead, it incrementally maintains a persistent wiki: source pages, concept pages, entity pages, position pages, question pages, an index, and a log. The wiki compounds over time.

This repository contains the public structure only. Your actual knowledge stays private and will never get accessed by anyone else.

## Quick Start

Create or `cd` into the folder you want to use as your knowledge system, then run:

```sh
npx github:ClaudiusMa/Personal-Knowledge-System init
```

## Privacy Model

GitHub holds structure, not content.

Private content lives under:

```text
wiki/
```

That folder is ignored by git. Private content includes:

- raw source files
- source URLs
- source summaries
- personal takes
- sparks
- entity pages
- concept pages
- position pages
- question pages
- `index.md`
- `log.md`

The `.gitignore` uses a whitelist approach: ignore everything by default, then explicitly allow only the public structure files.

    ├── entities/
    ├── concepts/
    ├── positions/
    └── questions/
```

## Page Types

- `source`: an annotation layer for one ingested source. References the original file in `wiki/main/raw/` via the `file:` frontmatter and a `## Source` embed. Contains a factual `## What's in this source` index, the user's `## My take` (dated, updatable), and `## Sparks`. The original file is the source of truth; the source page never duplicates its content.
- `entity`: a concrete recurring thing
- `concept`: a neutral idea, term, pattern, or framework
- `position`: a personal claim or sustained view
- `question`: an unresolved question being tracked

Position pages are intentionally separate from concept pages. Concepts describe ideas. Positions capture what the owner currently believes about those ideas.

## Workflows

### Ingest

The LLM reads the private index, reads related pages, processes a new source, checks for contradictions with earlier takes and positions, creates or updates pages, updates the index, and appends the log.

### Query

The LLM reads the private index first, then relevant pages, then answers from the wiki. Durable synthesis can be promoted into a concept, position, or question page when the user approves.

### Lint

The LLM periodically checks for stale pages, missing links, contradictions, orphan pages, missing index entries, and takes or sparks that should be promoted.

## Direction

The long-term goal is a dedicated frontend for *reading* the wiki — built around how a human consumes source-derived knowledge, not how a graph database stores it. Implications for current ingest decisions:

- **Concepts as retrieval tags.** Concept pages stay lean and tag-like (one-line definition, list of inbound sources, a few wikilinks to adjacent concepts). The future frontend will use concepts as the primary retrieval key, so heavy prose makes retrieval noisy.
- **Related pages → "you might also be interested."** Each source page's `## Related pages` section is the foundation for a recommended-next-read block in the future frontend.
- **Frontend independence.** Markdown stays plain — avoid platform-specific plugin syntax (Dataview, advanced templating). `[[wikilinks]]` and `![[embeds]]` are kept since they're the link primitive of the system.
- **Meta-bookkeeping excluded from graph view.** `wiki/main/raw/`, `wiki/main/index.md`, and `wiki/main/log.md` are filtered out of graph rendering in whatever frontend platform is used.
- **Generated artifacts excluded from graph and frontend.** `artifact/` holds shareable deliverables built *from* wiki facts (e.g. a roadmap or dashboard app), not knowledge to ingest. It is hidden from the frontend platform UI via ignore filters and must be filtered out of graph rendering. The system treats it like `schema/` and `bin/`: structure, not knowledge.

## Frontend Platform Defaults

The system works with any markdown-compatible frontend (Obsidian, Logseq, etc.). Frontend configuration is not part of the public schema — set it up however you prefer.

The following structural paths should be excluded from your frontend's graph view, search, and navigation so they don't pollute the knowledge graph:

- `CLAUDE.md`
- `README.md`
- `LICENSE`
- `package.json`
- `.gitignore`
- `schema/`
- `bin/`
- `artifact/`

Additionally, hiding `wiki/main/raw/` from graph view prevents duplicate nodes (one for the original file, one for the source page that annotates it). Raw files remain fully searchable, openable, and embeddable — they are only hidden from the visual graph.

## Using This With an LLM Agent

Point your LLM agent at the knowledge system directory and tell it to follow `CLAUDE.md`. The schema is intentionally plain markdown. No plugins, databases, vector search, or static-site tooling are required at the start.

Start with one broad wiki. Add structure only when real friction appears.
